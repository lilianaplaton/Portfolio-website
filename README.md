# Personal portfolio website

I created personal projects for small businesses, be it websites, UI/UX, logos, brand identity, or print.

The skills, technologies, and tools I use to bring products to life are: Figma, Photoshop, video editor DaVinci Resolve, mockup, GIT, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
